/** A spinlock is the fastest and most simple thread lock mechanism available.

  * thus it is the fastest thread lock available. Spinlocks are efficient if threads are only likely to be blocked for a
  * short period of time, as they avoid overhead from operating system process re-scheduling or context switching. However,
  * spinlocks become wasteful if held for longer durations, both preventing other threads from running and requiring
  * re-scheduling.
  * \note Spinlocks does not support recursive locking. A thread attempting to lock the same spinlock twice will wait
