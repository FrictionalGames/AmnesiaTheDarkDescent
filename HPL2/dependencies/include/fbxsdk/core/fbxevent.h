/** FBX SDK event base class. 
  * An event is something that is emitted by an emitter, with the goal of being filled by the listener that listen to it. 
  * You can see that like a form that you send to some people. If those people know how to fill the form, they fill it and return
  * it to you with the right information in it. FBX object could be used as emitter, since FbxObject is derived from FbxEmitter.
  * Meanwhile, plug-in could be used as listener, since FbxPlugin is derived from FbxListener.
  * The derived class of FbxEventBase contains a type ID to distinguish different types of events.
  * FBX object can emit different types of FBX events at different conditions. 
  * \par The whole process of event is:
  * \li 1. Create an emitter and a listener, then bind them together via the same event handler.
  * \li 2. Emitter can emit an event at certain conditions. The event could be handled by event handler.
  * \li 3. Once an event is emitted, the listener to this event will receive a signal. 
  * \li 4. And then the listener could process the event data according to the types of event, by calling event handler.
  * \note The event data is process by the callback function of event handler.
  * For example, if a certain property of a FBX object is changed, the FBX object(emitter) can emit an event which type is FbxObjectPropertyChanged.
  * The plug-in(listener) who are listening to FbxObjectPropertyChanged, will receive a signal and take action to process the event data.
