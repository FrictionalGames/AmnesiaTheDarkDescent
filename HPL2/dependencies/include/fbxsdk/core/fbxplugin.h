/** The base class to inherit from when creating new plug-ins for the FBX SDK. Plug-ins for the FBX SDK are extremely flexible
  * allowing a wide-range of possibilities. For example, one can write his own plug-in to add new readers/writers to the current list
  * of supported I/O formats, or add new dynamic classes to instantiate custom objects that can later be stored in FBX files. We also use the same
  * interface for plug-ins written using the FBX Extension SDK, which allow additional callbacks for other various Autodesk products
  * enabling greater interoperability with multiple various SDKs.
  *
  * Here is typical implementation of an FBX SDK plug-in that doesn't do anything else than just registering itself:
  * \code
  * class MyPlugin : public FbxPlugin
  * {
  *     FBXSDK_PLUGIN_DECLARE(MyPlugin); //This macro is mandatory for any plug-in definition
  *
  * protected:
  *     explicit MyPlugin(const FbxPluginDef& pDefinition, FbxModule pModuleHandle) : FbxPlugin(pDefinition, pModuleHandle)

  *     virtual bool SpecificInitialize()
  *     {
  *         //For example, here we could register as many new I/O readers/writers as we would like, or classes, etc.
  *         return true;

  *     {
  *         //Here we would have to unregister whatever we registered to the FBX SDK
  *         return true;
  *     }
  * };

  * #ifdef FBXSDK_ENV_WIN
