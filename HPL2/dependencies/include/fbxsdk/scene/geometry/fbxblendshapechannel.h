/** Class for blend shape channels. 
  * A blend shape channel is a sub-deformer to help blend shape deformer to organize the target shapes.
  * One blend shape deformer can have multiple blend shape channels in parallel, and each of them can 
  * control one or multiple target shapes. If there are multiple target shapes connected to one channel,
  * each target shape could have its own full deformation percentage. For example, given a channel that 
  * has 3 target shapes, whose full deform percentage are 30, to 80 to 100 separately, then when the percent 
  * changes from 0 to 100, the base geometry will deform from the first target shape to the last one. 
  * This is called in-between blend shapes or progressive morph.
  * The property DeformPercent of blend shape channel will control the deform level of each target shape or 
  * in-between blend shape on it.
