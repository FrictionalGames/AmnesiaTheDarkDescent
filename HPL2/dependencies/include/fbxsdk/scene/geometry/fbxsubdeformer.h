/**  Base class for cluster sub-deformer( FbxCluster) and blend shape channel sub-deformer( FbxBlendShapeChannel)
  *
  *  The corresponding sub-deformer types are FbxSubDeformer::eCluster and FbxSubDeformer::eBlendShapeChannel.
  *  
  * A cluster, or link, is an entity acting on a geometry (FbxGeometry).
  * More precisely, the cluster acts on a subset of the geometry's control points.
  * For each control point that the cluster acts on, the intensity of the cluster's
  * action is modulated by a weight. The link mode (ELinkMode) specifies how
  * the weights are taken into account.
  * The cluster's link node specifies the node (FbxNode) that influences the
  * control points of the cluster. If the node is animated, the control points
  * will move accordingly.
  * A cluster is usually part of a skin (see FbxDeformer, FbxSkin). For example,
  * imagine a mesh representing a humanoid, and imagine a skeleton made of bones. 
  * Each bone is represented by a node in FBX.
  * To bind the geometry to the nodes, 
  * we create a skin (FbxSkin). The skin has many clusters, each one corresponding
  * to a bone.
  * Each node influences some control
  * points of the mesh. A node has a high influence on some of the points (high weight)
  * and lower influence on some other points (low weight). Some points of the mesh
  * are not affected at all by the bone, so they would not be part of the corresponding
  * cluster.
  *
  * A blend shape channel is a sub-deformer to help blend shape deformer to organize the target shapes.
  * One blend shape deformer can have multiple blend shape channels in parallel, and each of them can 
  * control one or multiple target shapes. If there are multiple target shapes connected to one channel,
  * and each target shape could have its own full deformation percentage, for example, one channel could have 3 target shapes,
  * whose full deform percentage are 30, to 80 to 100, then when the percent change from 0 to 100, the base geometry will
  * deform from the first target shape to the last one, this is called In-Between blend-shapes.
  * The blend shape channel also control the deform percent of each target shape or In-Between blend shape on it.
