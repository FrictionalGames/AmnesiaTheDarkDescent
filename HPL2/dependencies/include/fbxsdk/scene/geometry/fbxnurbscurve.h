/**
    A Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) curve is a type of parametric geometry. A NURBS
    curve is defined by the order, form, knot vector and control points. 

	Let M be the order of the curve.
	Let N be the number of control points of the curve.

	The form of the curve can be open, closed or periodic. A curve with end points
	that do not meet is defined as an open curve. The number of knots in an open curve
	is defined as N+(M+1). 
	
	A closed curve simply has its last control point equal to its first control point. 
	Note that this does not imply tangent continuity at the end point.  The curve may 
	have a kink at this point.  In FBX the last control point is not specified by the user
	in the InitControlPoints() method. For example, if there are to be 10 control points in
	total, and the curve is to be closed, than only 9 control points need to be passed 
	into the InitControlPoints() method. The last control point is implied to be equal
	to the first control point. Thus N represents the number of unique CVs. 

	A periodic curve has its last M control points equal to its first M control points. 
	A periodic curve is tangent continuous at the ends. Similar to a closed curve,
	when creating a periodic curve, only the unique control points need to be set. For
	example a periodic curve of order 3 with 10 control points requires only 7 CVs to 
	be specified in the InitControlPoints() method. The last 3 CVs, which are the same as
	the first 3, are not included. 

	The calculation of the number of knots in closed and periodic curves is more complex. 
	Since we have excluded one CV in N in a closed curve, the number of knots is N+(M+1)+1. 
	Similarly, we excluded M CVs in periodic curves so the number of knots is N+(M+1)+M. 

	Note that FBX stores one extra knot at the beginning and and end of the knot vector,
	compared to some other graphics applications such as Maya. The two knots are not 
	used in calculation, but they are included so that no data is lost when converting
	from file formats that do store the extra knots.
