/** Class for clusters (links). 
  * A cluster, or link, is an entity acting on a geometry (FbxGeometry).
  * More precisely, the cluster acts on a subset of the geometry's control points.
  * For each control point that the cluster acts on, the intensity of the cluster's
  * action is modulated by a weight. The link mode (ELinkMode) specifies how
  * the weights are taken into account.
  *
  * The cluster's link node specifies the node (FbxNode) that influences the
  * control points of the cluster. If the node is animated, the control points
  * will move accordingly.
  *
  * A cluster is usually part of a skin (\see FbxDeformer, FbxSkin). For example,
  * imagine a mesh representing a humanoid, and imagine a skeleton made of bones. 
  * Each bone is represented by a node in FBX.
  * To bind the geometry to the nodes, 
  * we create a skin (FbxSkin). The skin has many clusters, each one corresponding
  * to a bone.
  * Each node influences some control
  * points of the mesh. A node has a high influence on some of the points (high weight)
  * and lower influence on some other points (low weight). Some points of the mesh
  * are not affected at all by the bone, so they would not be part of the corresponding
  * cluster.
