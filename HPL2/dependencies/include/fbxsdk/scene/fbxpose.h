/** This class contains the description of a Pose and provide some methods to access Pose info in one FBX scene.
  * \nosubgrouping
  * The FbxPose object can be setup to hold "Bind Pose" data or "Rest Pose" data.
  *
  * The Bind Pose holds the transformation (translation, rotation and scaling)
  * matrix of all the nodes implied in a link deformation. This includes the geometry
  * being deformed, the links deforming the geometry, and recursively all the
  * ancestors nodes of the link. The Bind Pose gives you the transformation of the nodes
  * at the moment of the binding operation when no deformation occurs.
  *
  * The Rest Pose is a snapshot of a node transformation. A Rest Pose can be used
  * to store the position of every node of a character at a certain point in
  * time. This pose can then be used as a reference position for animation tasks,
  * like editing walk cycles.
  *
  * One difference between the two modes is in the validation performed before
  * adding an item and the kind of matrix stored.
  *
  * In "Bind Pose" mode, the matrix is assumed to be defined in the global space,
  * while in "Rest Pose" the type of the matrix may be specified by the caller. So
  * local system matrices can be used. Actually, because there is one such flag for
  * each entry (FbxPoseInfo), it is possible to have mixed types in a FbxPose elements.
  * It is therefore the responsibility of the caller to check for the type of the retrieved
  * matrix and to do the appropriate conversions if required.
  *
  * The validation of the data to be added consists of the following steps:
  *
  *     \li If this FbxPose object stores "Bind Poses", then
  *        add a FbxPoseInfo only if the node is not already
  *        associated to another "Bind Pose". This check is done
  *        by visiting ALL the FbxPose objects in the system.
  *
  *        The above test is only performed for the "Bind Pose" type. While
  *        the next one is always performed, no matter what kind of poses this
  *        FbxPose object is setup to hold.
  *
  *     \li If a node is already inserted in the FbxPose internal list,
  *        then the passed matrix MUST be equal to the one already stored.
  *        If this is not the case, the Add method will return -1, indicating
  *        that no new FbxPoseInfo has been created.
  *
  * If the Add method succeeds, it will return the index of the FbxPoseInfo
  * structure that as been created and held by the FbxPose object.
  *
  * To ensure data integrity, the stored information can only be
  * accessed using the provided methods (read-only). If an entry needs to be
  * modified, the caller has to remove the FbxPoseInfo item by calling Remove(i)
  * and then Add a new one.
  *
  * The internal list is not ordered and the search inside this list is linear
  * (from the first element to ... the first match or the end of the list).
  *
