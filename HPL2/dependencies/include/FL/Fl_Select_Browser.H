  The class is a subclass of Fl_Browser

  the empty space.  As long as the mouse button is held down on an
  unselected item it is highlighted. Normally the callback is done when the
  user presses the mouse, but you can change this with when().
  <P>See Fl_Browser for  methods to add and remove lines from the browser.
