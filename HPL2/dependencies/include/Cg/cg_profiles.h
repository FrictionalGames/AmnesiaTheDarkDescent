 * The following macro invocations define the supported CG profiles.
 *
 * The macros have the form :
 *
 *   CG_PROFILE_MACRO(name, compiler_id, compiler_opt)
 *
 *     name         : The name of the profile.  Used consistently with the API.
 *     compiler_id  : The identifier string for the profile used by the compiler.
 *     compiler_id_caps : compiler_id in caps.
 *     compiler_opt : The command-line switch used to force compilation into
 *                    the profile.
 *     int_id           : Integer enumerant associated with this bind location.
 *     vertex_profile   : Non-zero if this is a vertex profile, otherwise it
 *                        is considered to be a fragment profile.
